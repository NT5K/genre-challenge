# The Genre Challenge

## About the Game

## How to Play
1. **Select a Movie Genre**: Start by choosing a genre from the dropdown list. The genres range from Action to Western, encompassing a wide variety of choices.

2. **Search for Movies**: Once a genre is selected, search for movies within that genre. You'll need to use your knowledge or best guess to pick movies that, when combined, have IMDb ratings close to 10/10.

3. **Choose Two Movies**: Select two movies from your search results. Their combined IMDb ratings are calculated and displayed.

4. **Score Calculation**: Your goal is to get as close to a 10/10 score as possible. The score is the sum of the IMDb ratings of the two selected movies.

5. **Winning the Game**: If your combined score is exactly 10/10, you win! If it's less, you can try again (the closest to 10/10 wins), but if it's more, you've gone over and lose the round.
